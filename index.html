					</header>

					<p>
					At Flying in Control Engineering (FICE), a dedicated group of four mechanical
					engineering students share a common goal: design, build and test the highest payload
					airplane using aircraft design fundamentals, past experience, and engineering intuition.
				</p>

					<p>
					FICE aims to further develop skills in project management and engineering design
					during this aircraft design project, which will enhance the team members early career
					skill development.

				<h1>Competition Day!</h1>

				<blockquote>
					<h5>
						Today, July 26th, was competition day. The teams hard work certainly payed off as our airplane passed and exceeded all expectations of the group!
					</h5>

					<h5>
						The day started off with FICE set to be the first run of the day. With nerves high, the team began at a conservative payload of 15% soaring through multiple laps setting the standard for all other teams for the day.
					</h5>

					<h5>
						Next, payload was increased to 35% and 51% completing near perfect runs and rivaling last years victors.
					</h5>

					<h5>
						With hopes high, the team increased total weight to 56%. Here the landing was not as smooth as the previous runs. But with this the still managed managed to complete the entire run as per competition specifications and was considered successful. This was a huge internal success as the team’s design choices of rugged materials truly payed off. The team decided after seeing the rough landing that this would be our final run and the plane had reached its limits at 56% payload.
					</h5>

					<h5>
						Overall, this day was a huge success specifically for our team being the top payload aircraft of the entire day, and as well seeing how many other teams were able to fly successfully!

				<h1>Manufacturing Complete!</h1>

				<blockquote>

					<h5>
						Today marks the day that FICE completed the initial prototype plane, including manfucaturing, assembly, and electrical! The plane has come together quite well. An intial worry was that by using a higher density foam for our fuselage to pad landings, we would end up overweight. This turned out to not be an issue as the carbon fiber rod balanced reduced the weight sufficiently. Currently the Center of Gravity seems much too far backwards and this will have to be optimized before the competition.

					<h5>
						This report is the third in a series of four reports and serves to determine an optimal aircraft through detailed design. This report covers the basic sizing and performance specifications, XFLR5 design analysis, refined sizing using analysis results, and a preliminary computed aided design (CAD) model of the remote control (RC) airplane.
